Source of the game: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/

Please install gym packages as below:
    pip install gymnasium
    pip install 'gymnasium[box2d]'
And also make sure pygame package is available in your python environment. 

How to play as a human:
(1) Use arrow keys to play the game. 
(2) Your goal is to move the agent on the ice to the goal at bottom right while avoiding felling into the holes. 
(3) Be careful, the ice board is super slippery. The agent will move in intended direction with probability of 1/3 
else will move in either perpendicular direction with equal probability of 1/3 in both directions.
(4) You may need to manually force quit the game after playing. You may modify the code to update a better quit mechanism.
